## Software Evolution, Maintenance and Improvement - Done Right!

* **analyze** issues, risks, problems, symptoms and technical debt within software (and their organisations).
* **evaluate** those issues, identify root-causes and remedies, prioritize.
* **improve** by applying appropriate remedies, strategies and tactics.
