=== Take What They Mean, Not What They Say 

==== Intent
Find out the real meaning/intention of stakeholders


==== Description
What people mean/want/need is sometimes not what they say. This is due either to semantic differences
on sender and receive sides,  or to other reasons.


NLP (neurolingustic programming) practitioners recommend to _mirror_ things you hear to your communication partners
in your own words. This might facilitate understanding.



==== Applicability
Apply this pattern whenever you communicate to other people (aka stakeholders).


==== Consequences
Improved understanding between stakeholders.



==== Related Patterns
* In every <<Stakeholder-Interview>> you should apply this pattern. 
* <<Stakeholder-Analysis>> to find out, who are the important stakeholders you should apply this pattern to.

==== References
Special thanx to Phillip Ghadir (innoQ) for giving this pattern its name.
