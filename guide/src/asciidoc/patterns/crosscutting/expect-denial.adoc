[[Expect-Denial]]
=== [pattern]#Expect Denial#

Some people will oppose your findings, will whitewash or sugarcoat issues, problems or <<Root-Cause-Analysis, root causes>>. Regardless on how careful you prepared your analysis, they will try to diminish, attack or dispute your findings. 

==== Intent

* Prepare you (as analyzer or evaluator or systems) for serious opposition and resistance by some stakeholders.
* Describe which kind of reaction might be turned into acceptance.
* Describe what might be gained by certain slightly negative reactions.

. *Resistance*: Findings are opposed, either actively or passively.
. *Hostility*, or "_Shoot the messenger_" 

==== Experiences
TBD

==== Consequences
Especially when presenting results to (opposing) management stakeholders, you should be able to *verify* all your claims. In critical cases you should keep written protocols and note who-said-what in your <<Stakeholder-Interview, stakeholder interviews>>.
