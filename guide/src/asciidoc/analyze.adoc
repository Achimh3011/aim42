== Analyze

image::analyze.jpg["analyze-phase", title="Analyze-Phase"]

=== Goals

. Obtain overview of intent, purpose and quality requirements of the system (<<SuD>>).

. Develop and document an understanding of internal structures, concepts and architectural approaches.

. Find all problems, issues, symptoms, risks or technical debt within the system (<<SuD>>), its operation, maintenance or otherwise related processes.

. Understand root causes of the problems found, potential interdependencies between issues


=== How it works

Systematically look for such issues at various places and with various people.

TIP: To effectively find issues, you need an appropriate amount of _understanding_ of the system under design (<<SuD>>), its technical concepts, code-structure, inner workings, major external interfaces and its development process. 


. Begin with <<Stakeholder-Analysis>>, then conduct <<Stakeholder-Interview>> with important stakeholders.
. Get an initial understanding of the <<SuD>> by 
  .. <<Context-Analysis>>
  .. <<Documentation-Analysis>>, read especially the architecture documentation, focus on <<View-Based-Understanding>>.
  .. <<Development-Process-Analysis>> 
  .. Perform <<Static-Code-Analysis>> to learn about code structure _in-the-large_. This also helps to identify risky code.
. <<Capture-Quality-Requirements>> from the _authoritative_ stakeholders of the systems.
. Conduct a <<Qualitative-Analysis>> of the system, its architecture and associated organization, 
based upon the specific quality requirements
  .. Inspect and analyze all involved organizational processes -
    (development, project-management, operations, requirements-analysis)
. Perform <<Runtime-Analysis>> or <<Quantitative-Analysis>>, e.g. performance and load monitoring, process and thread analysis
. Inspect the data created, modified and queried by the system, for structure, size, volume or specialities
. Together with appropriate stakeholders, do <<Root-Cause-Analysis>> of major issues found - as symptoms and causes may differ.

WARNING: Never start solving problems until you have a thorough understanding of current stakeholder requirements. Otherwise you risk wasting effort in areas which no influential stakeholder cares about.
