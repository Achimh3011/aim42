== Analyze

=== Goals

. Obtain overview of intent, purpose and quality requirements of the system (<<SuD>>).

. Develop and document an understanding of internal structures, concepts and architectural approaches.

. Find all problems, issues, symptoms, risks or technical debt within the system (<<SuD>>), its operation, maintenance or otherwise related processes.

. Understand root causes of the problems found, potential interdependencies between issues


=== How it works

Systematically look for such issues at various places and with various people.

TIP: To effectively find issues, you need an appropriate amount of _understanding_ of the system under design (<<SuD>>), its technical concepts, code-structure, inner workings, major external interfaces and its development process.


. Start <<Capture-Quality-Requirements, capturing current quality requirements>> from the _authoritative_ stakeholders of the systems.
. Conduct a [pattern]#<<Qualitative-Analysis, qualitative analysis>># of the system,
its architecture and surrounding organization, based upon the specific quality requirements
. Perform [pattern]#<<Static-Code-Analysis, static code analysis>>#
. Conduct [pattern]#<<Stakeholder-Interview, stakeholder interviews>>#
. Perform a number of *[pattern]#runtime analysis#*, e.g. performance and load monitoring, process and thread analysis
. Inspect the data created, modified and queried by the system, for structure, size, volume or specialities
. Inspect and analyze all involved organizational processes
(development, project-management, operations, requirements-analysis)


WARNING: Never start solving problems until you have a thourough understanding of current stakeholder requirements. Otherwise you risk wasting effort in areas that no influential stakeholder cares about.
