[[Evaluate]]
== Evaluate

=== Goals

Make the issues, problems and risks found during the *analysis* comparable by
determining their *value* (that's why we call this activity *evaluate*):

. determine _value_ of problems, issues, risks and their remedies 
. prioritize issues, their remedies and improvement measures 


=== Pattern and Practices for Evaluation

* Determine Feature Value
* Determine Problem Cost
* Estimate Remedy Cost
* Failure Mode And Effect Analysis
* Impact Analysis
* <<Root-Cause-Analysis, Root Cause Analysis>> - finding the root-cause of problems
* Separate Cause From Effect
