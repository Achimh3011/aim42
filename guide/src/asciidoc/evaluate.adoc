[[Evaluate]]
== Evaluate

In the evaluation phase we need to understand root causes of the problems found,
potential interdependencies between issues and their impacts.



=== Goals

* Make the issues, problems and risks found during the *analysis* comparable by
determining their *value* (that's why we call this activity *evaluate*).

* Understand root causes for the issues or symptoms found during analysis

=== Pattern and Practices for Evaluation

* <<Debugging>>
* Determine Feature Value
* Determine Problem Cost
* Estimate Remedy Cost
* Failure Mode And Effect Analysis
* Impact Analysis
* <<Root-Cause-Analysis, Root Cause Analysis>> - finding the root-cause of problems
* Separate Cause From Effect
