[[Runtime-Analysis]]

==== [pattern]#Runtime-Analysis# 

===== Intent
Analyze the runtime behavior of the <<System>>, e.g. with respect to time and resource consumption or creation. 


===== Description

* Ask stakeholders about _perceived_ runtime behavior - double check by measuring.

* Measure runtime behavior, e.g. with profilers, logs or traces.

* Inspect _artifacts_ created at runtime (e.g. logfiles, protocolls, system-traces) for information about problems, root-causes or system behavior.

* Perform <<Infrastructure-Analysis>> to learn about the technical infrastructure.

// TODO: perhaps Log-Analysis deserves a separate entry? Especially in security

WARNING:: Measuring might influence behavior. That can be especially disturbing in multi-threaded, multi-user or multi-core applications.
