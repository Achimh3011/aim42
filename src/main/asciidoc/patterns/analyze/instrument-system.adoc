==== [pattern]#Instrument System#

// TODO: MM: Find some witty reference to make the pattern more memorable

Use retroactive modification of the executables which target
cross-cutting concerns to make the existing software-base tell about it's
internals. Ways to achieve this can include <<Aspect-Oriented-Programming,
Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)>>, <<Monkey-Patching, Monkey Patching>> and
other <<meta-programming, meta programming>> techniques.

===== Intent

Find out how the system is really used and what the runtime relationships are,
as well as other facts that can not be easily determined by
<<Static-Code-Analysis>> even in situation where the system under design is
largely undocumented and the architecture work thus mostly relies on
assumptions, interviews and lore.

===== Description
In many languages today it is possible to define operation that alter the
behavior of certain structures in the system without modifying the original
source code. In Java this is often done by byte code instrumentation, in Ruby,
PHP and some other languages there are built in mechanisms to (re-) define the
behavior of system classes or libraries. 

In theory instrumenting the system therefore is a straightforward process:

* Identify and describe the concern that shall be explored (e.g.
  obectect-creation, function entries and exits, code execution or somethings
  else that can be described in the terms of the mechanism used).
* Write the code that collects the data about the system behavior (e.g. sends it
  to a syslog, writes it to a file, sends it to a dedicated server, creates an
  SNMP Trap etc.)
* Use the (language specific) mechanism to create the instrumented version of
  the system
* Replace (part of) the currently operational system with the instrumented version
* Collect the data
* Replace the instrumented version with the previously operational version

In real life, since the mechanisms of instrumentation vary widely, specific ways
must be found for each scenario. 

While tools like AspectJ provide easy ways to instrument Java-Code and Rubyâ€™s
metaprogramming model allows for easy introduction of crosscutting functionality
the same gets harder to do with other languages. In some languages it may be
necessary to modify a dynamically linked library with central operations to
introduce instrumentation without modifying the original system. 

[TIP]
--
A special form of this pattern, especially useful for interpreted languages, is
_instrumenting the source code manually_. Basically all you do here is manually type in
the code to collect the information you're interested in. In this case it is
especially important to have a tried and tested way to replace the instrumented
system back with the original system!

===== Experiences

WARNING: even if used cautiously, the instrumentation the system under design can
entail heavy performance penalties (on execution time, space used, bandwith
etc.) so alway make sure that there is a quick way to switch back to the
original un-instrumented version.

===== Applicability
The pattern is almost universally applicable as long as there is a way to
introduce instrumentation to the executable and <<operations>> can be
convinced that it is possible to switch back from the instrumented version
real fast.
