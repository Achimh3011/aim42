==== [pattern]#Change-by-Split Approach#

===== Prerequisites

The system has several distinct (usually nearly disjunct) user groups.
For each of these groups, slightly different business rules, processes
or other requirements hold.

===== Intent

Maintain and evolve a few smaller systems, instead of one big monolith.
Reduce time-to-market, work in smaller teams that individually become
more focussed.

===== Description

1. Identify different user groups, at best disjunct. An example: For an
online E-commerce system, such groups might be private and corporate customers.

2. As a preparation, copy the whole system, with all sources and everything
required to develop, build, test and run the system. This might include
databases or other middleware. Every part should be completely independend
of the others.

3. Identify commonalities among these different user groups, crosscutting concerns
that every user group needs in a common way. In our E-commerce example,
those might be pdf-generation, user/role management or the like. Factor out those
commons into a separate module/subsystem, which is used by (likely all) other split systems.

4. Now you can optimize and/or refactor the commons subsystem. As its code
is now centralized, that task might become somewhat simpler than within
the original legacy system. At the same time, remove all commons-code from the split
systems - reducing them in size.

5. Now for the core of this approach: Aggressively reduce every split system
to its core: remove all code not required for the split-specific
user group, remove all code that can also be handled by the Commons subsystem.
This step might be performed parallel to optimizing the commons.

===== Experiences

* An niche-market software supplier could reduce their
2+Million LoC _moloch_ to five _split_ systems, each having
approx 300kLoC plus one commons-system.
+
Time-to-market for feature requests was reduced from 12 weeks
before the splits to 1 week afterwards. Team size of 50+ was
reduced to 8+ people. A retrospective approx 9 month after
the split showed significant higher customer satisfaction
and (!) a significant increase in developer happiness
(probably reducing know-how drain). The split-approach was
regarded as a success by business, management and technical stakeholdes.


===== Risks

* Creating several copies of a large system plus infrastructure
can be expensive and resource-intensive.
* Identifying really disjunct user groups might be impossible for
several business domains, rendering this approach useless.
* The required team-split might pose organizational challenges,
as a currently productive (albeit large) team has to be disrupted.
* The various user groups

===== Applicability

Whenever a legacy system servers more than one homogeneous user
group, this split approach might be appropriate.

The business processes for the various user groups need to be
sufficiently different from one another - otherwise splits would
merely create duplicate functionality.

===== Consequences


===== Proposed practices

* Find a relatively small user-group and _pilot_ (try-out)
this approach.
* Involve the affected user groups as early as possible to
facilitate possible required changes on their side.
