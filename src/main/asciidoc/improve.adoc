== Improve

image::01-intro-and-overview/improve-phase.png["improve-phase", title="Improve-Phase"]

=== Goals

. Execute and coordinate the improvement activities to eliminate problems and issues found during <<Analyze, analysis>>. There is a whole <<improve-practices, bunch of practices>> devoted to this step, and we described the different  <<improvement-approaches, approaches>> you can take to run the improvements.

. Apply selected opportunities for improvement

* Change code, structures, concepts or processes to achieve better software,
* Reduce costs and/or technical debt,
* Eliminate issues found during analysis phase,
* Optimize quality attributes (like performance, maintainability, security),
* Optimize operation and administration processes, effort and cost.

.Concepts For Improvement


[horizontal]
<<Fundamentals>>:: Some principles which you should consider whatever steps you take on your road to improvement.

<<improvement-approaches, Approaches>>:: Overall (strategic, long-term) decisions how to tackle improvement. Examples include *Big-Bang*, *Strangulate-Bad-Parts*, *Change-Via-Split*.

<<improve-practices, Practices>>:: fine-grained practices or patterns, structured in several <<improve-categories,categories>>.


=== Fundamentals
For improvement we take a number of fundamental principles for granted,
depicted in figure <<Improvement Fundamentals>>.

These fundamental principles surely belong to software engineering good practices - but we consider them indispendsable for improvement projects.

[horizontal]
[pattern]#Fast-Feedback#::
Get feedback to your actions and changes as early as possible, so you can adjust as quickly as adequate.

[pattern]#Improve Iteratively#::
Improve in (potentially small) iterations and/or increments, so
that change does not disturb or negatively affect the system, its associated
processes and organisation. Iterations are the prerequiste for our whole _phased improvement_.

[pattern]#Prototype-Improvement#:: Verify the viability and effectiveness of improvements,
usually in smaller scales with reasonable risks.

[pattern]#Verify-After-Every-Change#:: Always make sure that changes,
even minor ones, leave your system intact. (The awesome Jerry Weinberg has written
up several http://secretsofconsulting.blogspot.de/2015/01/some-very-expensive-software-failures.html[examples of such failures]).

[pattern]#Reduce Complexity#:: Simpler solutions are most often easier to comprehend,
maintain and operate. Therefore always strive for simplicity and the reduction
of accidental, unneccessary complexity.

[pattern]#Explicit Assumption#:: Compensate missing facts (especially requirements, goals, estimates, opinions) by explicit (written) assumptions about those facts. See <<Explicit-Assumption>>.

[pattern]#Group Improvement Actions#:: Group related actions, so that they refer
to similar entities and potential synergies are utilized.
