=== Goals

. Plan and coordinate measures and opportunities for improvements to eliminate problems and issues found during <<Analyze, analysis>>. A whole <<Determine-Improvement-Approach ,category of practices>> is devoted to this step, called <<Determine-Improvement-Approach>>

. Apply selected opportunities for improvement

* Change code, structures, concepts or processes to achieve better software,
* Reduce costs and/or technical debt,
* Eliminate issues found during analysis phase,
* Optimize quality attributes (like performance, maintainability, security),
* Optimize operation and administration processes, effort and cost.

.Concepts For Improvement


[horizontal]
<<Fundamentals>>:: Some principles which you should consider whatever steps you take on your road to improvement.

<<Approaches>>:: Overall (strategic, long-term) decisions how to tackle improvement. Examples include *Big-Bang*, *Strangulate-Bad-Parts*, *Change-Via-Split*.  

<<improve-practices, Practices>>:: fine-grained practices or patterns, structured in several <<improve-categories,categories>>.


=== Fundamentals
For improvement we take a number of fundamental principles for granted, 
depicted in figure <<Improvement Fundamentals>>.


[[improve-fundamentals]]
.Improvement Fundamentals
image::improve-fundamentals.png[]

These fundamental principles surely belong to software engineering good practices - but we consider them indispendsable for improvement projects.

[horizontal]
[pattern]#Fast-Feedback#:: 
Get feedback to your actions and changes as early as possible, so you can adjust as quickly as adequate. 

[pattern]#Improve Iteratively#:: 
Improve in (potentially small) iterations and/or increments, so
that change does not disturb or negatively affect the system, its associated
processes and organisation. Iterations are the prerequiste for our whole _phased improvement_.

[pattern]#Prototype-Improvement#:: Verify the viability and effectiveness of improvements,
usually in smaller scales with reasonable risks. 

[pattern]#Verify-After-Every-Change#:: Always make sure that changes,
even minor ones, leave your system intact. (The awesome Jerry Weinberg has written
up several http://secretsofconsulting.blogspot.de/2015/01/some-very-expensive-software-failures.html[examples of such failures]).

[pattern]#Reduce Complexity#:: Simpler solutions are most often easier to comprehend,
maintain and operate. Therefore always strive for simplicity and the reduction
of accidental, unneccessary complexity.

[pattern]#Explicit Assumption#:: Compensate missing facts (especially requirements, goals, estimates, opinions) by explicit (written) assumptions about those facts. See <<Explicit-Assumption>>.

[pattern]#Group Improvement Actions#:: Group related actions, so that they refer
to similar entities and potential synergies are utilized.
 

[[improve-approaches]]
===  (Long-Term) Improve Approaches
The central decision you should take is the improvement-approach, the overall, long-range or *strategic* decision how you want to tackle your improvement.

TODO: Describe Approaches

[pattern]#Change-On-Copy#:: Create two or more identical copies of the whole system. Clean-up (reduce, gut) those copies individually, and then evolve the copies independently.

[pattern]#Change-Via-Split#:: Split up the original system into (not neccessarily distinct) parts. Clean-up those parts individually, and then evolve the parts independently. 
[small]#(similar, but not identical to Change-On-Copy)#

[pattern]#Keep-Data-Toss-Code#:: As value sometimes resides in data, keep data intact and replace the functional/service/process part of a system.

[pattern]#Frontend-Switch#:: Start creating new backend parts. Frontend routes some requests to those new backend parts, others still to the existing ones. Gradually enhancing the new backend parts, frontend routes more and more requests to new backend.

[pattern]#Big-Bang#:: Keep the existing system for a limited time, apply only critical bugfixes. In parallel, build a replacement system. Replace old by new at predefined time.

[pattern]#Chicken-Little#:: Incrementally (11 steps) build a replacement system. You can choose between Database-First, Database-Last and Composite-Database Approach.

[pattern]#Database-First#:: Do a Big-Bang migration of the database, incrementally implement new applications and interfaces and connect the legacy system to the new database by forward gateways.

[pattern]#Database-Last#:: Keep the existing database for a limited time, incrementally implement new applications and interfaces and connect them to the legacy database by reverse gateways.

[pattern]#Composite-Database#:: Combination of Database-Firt and Database-Last. Beside a forward- and reverse-gateway, there is a need for a transaction-coordinator.

[pattern]#Butterfly-Methodology#:: Data-Migration Method without the need for gateways. Enables zero-downtime migrations by working with temporary data stores.

[pattern]#Strangulate-Bad-Parts#:: TBD


[pattern]#Evolution#:: This approach has been extensively practiced by a Swiss Bank and published
as a  http://www.amazon.de/Managed-Evolution-Strategy-Information-Systems/dp/3642016324[book]. 
Underlying idea is to refactor those parts of the system(s) which are actually to be changed, especially to move all interfaces to new service standard and replace all legacy technologies and other couplings (via DB etc). Over time services should emerge that can be moved to a new platform altogether (from Mainframe to Java).

[[improve-categories]]
=== Categories of Improvement Practices

We divide improvement practices into several categories (shown in 
the figure below). In contrast to the (more _strategic_) approaches
these practices are more a _tactical_ nature. 


[[improvement-categories]]
.Categories of Improvement Practices
image::improve-practice-categories.png[title="Categories of Improvement Practices"]

// TODO: Describe meaning/definition of categories


* <<mprove-processes, Improve Processes>>: Improve processes _around_ the system, its requirements,
engineering, delivery, operations and management. 
* <<improve-architecture, Improve Architecture and Code Structure>>: refactor, restructure, modularize and similar practices.
* <<improve-technical-infrastructure, Improve Technical Infrastructure>>
* <<improve-analyzability, Improve Analyzability and Evaluability>>: facilitate to find issues, identify root causes or
