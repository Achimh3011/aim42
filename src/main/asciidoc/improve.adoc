=== Goals

. Plan and coordinate measures and opportunities for improvements to eliminate problems and issues found during <<Analyze, analysis>>.

. Apply selected opportunities for improvement

* Change code, structures, concepts or processes to achieve better software,
* Reduce costs and/or technical debt,
* Eliminate issues found during analysis phase,
* Optimize quality attributes (like performance, maintainability, security),
* Optimize operation and administration processes, effort and cost.




=== Structure of Improvement Practices

==== Fundamentals
For improvement we take a number of fundamental principles for granted:

[horizontal]
[pattern]#Improve Incrementally#:: Improve in (potentially small) increments, so
that change does not disturb or negatively affect the system, its associated
processes and organisation. Incremental improvements work well with _iterations_.

[pattern]#Prototype-Improvement#:: Verify the viability and effectiveness of improvements,
usually in smaller scales with reasonable risks. 

[pattern]#Fast-Feedback#:: Get feedback to your actions and changes as early as possible,
so you can adjust as quickly as adequate. 

[pattern]#Regression-Test-After-Every-Change#:: Always make sure that changes,
even minor ones, leave your system intact. 
// TODO: reference/link to sample stories of G.Weinberg (?)

[pattern]#Reduce Complexity#:: Simpler solutions are most often easier to comprehend,
maintain and operate. Therefore always strive for simplicity and the reduction
of accidental, unneccessary complexity.

[pattern]#Group Improvement Actions#:: Group related actions, so that they refer
to similar entities and potential synergies are utilized.
 

==== Categories

We divide improvement practices into several categories (shown in 
figure <<Improvement Categories>>).
