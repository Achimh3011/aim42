=== Goals

. Plan and coordinate measures and opportunities for improvements to eliminate problems and issues found during <<Analyze, analysis>>. A whole <<Determine-Improvement-Approach ,category of practices>> is devoted to this step, called <<Determine-Improvement-Approach>>

. Apply selected opportunities for improvement

* Change code, structures, concepts or processes to achieve better software,
* Reduce costs and/or technical debt,
* Eliminate issues found during analysis phase,
* Optimize quality attributes (like performance, maintainability, security),
* Optimize operation and administration processes, effort and cost.

.Concepts For Improvement


[horizontal]
<<Fundamentals>>:: Some principles which you should consider whatever steps you take on your road to improvement.

<<Approaches>>:: Overall decisions how to tackle improvement. Examples include *Big-Bang*, *Strangulate-Bad-Parts*, *Change-Via-Split*.  

<<improve-practices, Practices>>:: fine-grained practices or patterns, structured in several <<improve-categories,categories>>.

==== Fundamentals
For improvement we take a number of fundamental principles for granted, 
depicted in figure <<Improvement Fundamentals>>.


[[improve-fundamentals]]
.Improvement Fundamentals

[horizontal]
[pattern]#Fast-Feedback#:: Get feedback to your actions and changes as early as possible, 
so you can adjust as quickly as adequate. 

[pattern]#Improve Iteratively#:: Improve in (potentially small) iterations and/or increments, so
that change does not disturb or negatively affect the system, its associated
processes and organisation. Iterations are the prerequiste for our whole _phased improvement_.

[pattern]#Prototype-Improvement#:: Verify the viability and effectiveness of improvements,
usually in smaller scales with reasonable risks. 

[pattern]#Verify-After-Every-Change#:: Always make sure that changes,
even minor ones, leave your system intact. (The awesome Jerry Weinberg has written
up several http://secretsofconsulting.blogspot.de/2015/01/some-very-expensive-software-failures.html[examples of such failures]).

[pattern]#Reduce Complexity#:: Simpler solutions are most often easier to comprehend,
maintain and operate. Therefore always strive for simplicity and the reduction
of accidental, unneccessary complexity.

[pattern]#Explicit Assumption#:: Compensate missing facts (especially requirements, goals, estimates, opinions) by explicit (written) assumptions about those facts. See <<Explicit-Assumption>>.

[pattern]#Group Improvement Actions#:: Group related actions, so that they refer
to similar entities and potential synergies are utilized.
 

[[improve-approaches]]
==== Approaches
The central decision you should take is the improvement-approach, the overall, long-range or *strategic* decision how you want to tackle your improvement:

TODO: Describe Approaches

[pattern]#Change-Via-Split#:: Create two or more identical copies of the whole system. Clean-up (reduce, gut) those copies individually, and then evolve those copies independently.

* Change-Via-Copy
* Big-Bang
* Strangulate-Bad-Parts
* Keep-Data-Toss-Code
* Frontend-Switch

[[improve-categories]]
==== Categories

We divide improvement practices into several categories (shown in 
figure <<Improvement Categories>>).
