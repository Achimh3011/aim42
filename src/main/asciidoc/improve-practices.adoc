=== Improvement Practices (Details)

Practices, in contrast to approaches, are the short-term
or tactical improvements.

We already explained the categories of these improvement practices
in <<improve-practices-overview>>. Here we dive into more details,
structured along these categories:

* Improve Processes,see <<improve-processes>>
* Improve Architecture and Code Structure, see <<improve-architecture>>
* Improve Technical Infrastructure, see <<improve-technical-infrastructure>>
* Improve Analyzability, see <<improve-analyzability>>
