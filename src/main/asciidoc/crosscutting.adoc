== Cross-Cutting Practices and Patterns

. Start with collecting problems.
. Evaluate those, determine priorities and _values_. This ensures you later solve _important_ and _relevant_ problems.
. Aligned with your problems, keep a list of potential improvements.

[[Collect-Opportunities-For-Improvement]]
=== [pattern]#Collect Opportunities for Improvement#
You should look for improvement opportunities, remedies, measures,
tactics and strategies in all of the aim42-phases.

image::collect-remedies.png["collect remedies", title="Collect Remedies in All Phases"]


[[Collect-Issues]]
=== [pattern]#Collect Issues#
You should constantly watch out for issues (problems and risks), especially
during <<Analyze, analysis>> activities like <<Stakeholder-Interviews>> and others. 

The artifact (physical collection) is the <<Issue-List>>.

Regularly match these issues to your 
<<Collect-Opportunities-For-Improvement, collection of possible improvements>>.

[[Explicit-Assumption]]
=== [pattern]#Explicit Assumption#
Compensate missing facts (especially requirements, goals, estimates,
opinions) by explicit (usually written) assumptions about those facts.

==== Description
Making assumptions _explicit_ is fundamentally important to
<<Capture-Quality-Requirements>>, so that development teams don't
need to rely on implicit assumptions or requirements.

When evaluating problems, risks or remedies, we often need to
estimate or assume stuff like duration, cost, workload or others.
These estimates or assumptions need to be made _explicit_,
so that others can reproduce or understand our evaluation.
In case of numerical estimation, it helps to apply
<<Estimate-In-Interval>>


Also known as _educated guess_.



[[Fail-Fast]]
=== [pattern]#Fail Fast#
The later a lack of quality is identified the higher are the costs to fix it.
Continuously evaluate the quality of work artifacts and immediately take
countermeasures or pull the plug as early as possible. Similar to <<Fast-Feedback>>.

Suitable methods to identify such situations are:

* Code reviews
* Architecture reviews
* Peer reviews
* Testing in early stages


[[Fast-Feedback]]
=== [pattern]#Fast Feedback#
TODO

See also <<Fail-Fast>>.



[[Impact-Analysis]]
=== [pattern]#Impact Analysis#

==== Intent
Determine what impact (in code, concepts, data and the organization)
a specific action or issue (e.g. refactoring, recurring problem) will or
might have. Identify the resultant effects on system development and operations.


==== Related Practices

* Failure-Mode-and-Effect-Analysis (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis[FMEA]), a method for failure analysis, widely used in various industries



[[Improvement-Backlog]]
=== [pattern]#Improvement Backlog#
Keep a public, written backlog of possible improvements, remedies, tactics or strategies.

* Revise this backlog in regular intervalls.
* Define the _owner role_ for this backlog, similar to the _product owner_ in Scrum.
* Enhance the backlog with information from the <<evaluation>> phase, like cost, effort or risk.

image::improvement-backlog.jpg["improvement backlog", title="Improvement Backlog"]

[[Issue-List]]
=== [pattern]#Issue List#
A physical collection of issues (problems, risks) found during <<Collect-Issues>>.

It's difficult to decide how much formalism to apply in collecting issues and problems:
Sometimes a wiki-page might suffice, for other systems a full-blown
issue-tracker can be useful.

As always: documentation is only valuable if it can be found and searched -
which makes electronic approaches more viable.

For every entry in this issue list we need to <<Estimate-Issue-Cost>>, an estimation of the cost of this issued in any business-related unit. 

In case you already have identified or developed options to adress this issue,
links to the corresponding improvements (remedies, tactics, strategies, changes) in the
<<Improvement-Backlog>> are neccesssary.
